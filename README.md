I want to take you guys a step further in this article by demonstrating how to publish your web app so that others can view your AI models in Real Time.
What’s more, I’ll demonstrate how to build an Inventory Management System which manages cold beverages in real-time.
For our project we will be using Streamlit to build our web app and SQLite as a database.
